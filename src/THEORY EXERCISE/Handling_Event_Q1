1. How are events handled in React compared to vanilla JavaScript? Explain the
concept of synthetic events.

=> In vanilla JavaScript, event handling typically involves adding event listeners to DOM elements using methods like addEventListener

Key differences:

 A. Syntax: React uses camelCase (onClick), while vanilla JS uses lowercase (onclick).
 B. Binding: In vanilla JavaScript, you often need to explicitly bind this when using event handlers in classes. In  React, this is mostly avoided when using functional components and hooks.
 C. Event System: React uses a synthetic event system, while vanilla JS interacts directly with the native DOM      event system.

 Synthetic Events in React
React uses a SyntheticEvent system to wrap native events. A SyntheticEvent is a cross-browser wrapper around the browserâ€™s native event system, providing a consistent interface regardless of differences between browsers.
